# Chapter 12: Real-World Quantum Circuits 

While still in its early stages, quantum computing holds enormous promise for solving complex problems that are difficult for classical computers. Several real-world quantum circuits have emerged, demonstrating the practical applications of quantum computing in various fields. Here are two:

## The Bell State Circuit

**Application**: Quantum Teleportation and Quantum Cryptography

**Description**: The Bell State, often referred to as an entangled state, plays a pivotal role in quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography. It is created through a series of quantum gate operations to produce two qubits that are highly entangled, meaning the measurement of one instantly determines the state of the other, regardless of the physical distance between them. The Bell State circuit is integral in the development of secure quantum communication protocols.

## Simon's Algorithm Circuit

**Application**: Cryptography and Period Finding

**Description**: Simon's algorithm is a quantum algorithm designed for solving problems related to period finding, a task with applications in cryptography and code-breaking. It demonstrates quantum computing's ability to outperform classical algorithms in specific domains. By efficiently discovering periodicity in functions, Simon's Algorithm highlights the advantage of quantum computation in tasks like breaking encryption and code-cracking.

These are just the tip of the iceberg. As mentioned in previous chapters, there are other famous algorithms like Grover's Algorithm and Shor's Algorithm with proven capabilities.

- Grover's Algorithm provides a quadratic speedup in searching through unsorted databases compared to classical algorithms. 
- Shor's Algorithm efficiently factors large numbers, thus able to break public key cryptography.

As quantum technology evolves, with enhancements in hardware, error correction, fidelity, and coherence times, it's anticipated that quantum developers will become essential for every business. Seize this chance to continue developing your expertise and play a role in this transformative revolution.
