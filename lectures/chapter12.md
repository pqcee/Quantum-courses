# Chapter 12: Real-World Quantum Circuits

While still in its early stages, quantum computing holds enormous promise for solving complex problems that are difficult for classical computers. Several real-world quantum circuits have emerged, demonstrating the practical applications of quantum computing in various fields. Here are two:

## Quantum Fourier Transform

**Application**: Finance and Cryptography

**Description**: In quantum computing, the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is a linear transformation on quantum bits, and is the quantum analogue of the discrete Fourier transform. The quantum Fourier transform is a part of many quantum algorithms, notably Shor's algorithm for factoring and computing the discrete logarithm, the quantum phase estimation algorithm for estimating the eigenvalues of a unitary operator, and algorithms for the hidden subgroup problem.

## Grover's Algorithm

**Application**: Unstructured Search

**Description**: Grover's algorithm is designed to search for a specific item from an unsorted list, using fewer steps than classical search algorithms. Here's how it works:

1. Initialize the qubits: Start by putting the qubits into an equal superposition using Hadamard gates, which ensures that all possible states are equally likely.

2. Apply the oracle function: This oracle marks the state corresponding to the correct answer by flipping its phase.

3. Amplitude amplification: This is the key part of Grover's algorithm. After the oracle marks the correct answer, Groverâ€™s diffusion operator increases the amplitude (or likelihood) of the correct state and decreases the amplitude of others.

4. Repeat: The amplification process is repeated a certain number of times to maximize the chance of measuring the correct state. The number of repetitions depends on the size of the search space.

5. Measure: Once the correct state has a high probability, a measurement is made, and the output will most likely be the correct state.

Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms for search problems.
