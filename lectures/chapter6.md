# Chapter 6: The Pauli-Y gate

In QuICScript, we use the letter 'Y' to represent the Pauli-Y gate, mathematically it can be expressed using the matrix below:

![Matrix](./figures/Pauli-Y.png)

The Y-gate is both a bit flip gate and phase flip gate. It swaps the amplitudes and changes the sign at the same time for both |0⟩ and |1⟩.

_Note: The number of qubits required in the circuit for this gate is 1._
