# Getting Started (Lecturers)

## Github Classroom

### Workflow/Stakeholders

- pQCee builds course materials
- lecturer creates github classroom, uses our template repository, maintains repo, invites TAs & students, creates assignments, manages grading and feedback using GHA, adds students roster via LMS or manual
- student completes accepts assignment, forks repo, and completes assignments using circuit builder

### How to

1. Create or Set Organisation
2. Create Classroom
3. Create Assignment
4. Assign TAs & Invite students
5. Clone Repo
6. Launch Github Pages

## Configure Moodle for Github Classroom

1. Enable publishing as an LTI tool in Moodle
2. Register Github classroom as an external tool
3. Register your Moodle instance with Github Classroom
4. Link a Moodle Course with a Classroom or Add a new course in Moodle

# Introduction to Quantum Gates

In this course, you will embark on an exciting journey into how to build quantum programs using QuICScript. These fundamental chapters will provide you with a foundation in quantum computing, enabling you to understand and work with quantum gates, qubits, and practical applications.

## Chapters

1. The Qubit
2. Quantum Circuits
3. Identity Gate
4. Pauli-X gate
5. Pauli-Y gate
6. Pauli-Z gate
7. Hadamard gate
8. Control Not / Toffoli gate
9. P/S: Phase shift π/2
10. T: Phase shift π/4
11. How to use multiple gates together
12. Important real-world Quantum Circuits
